# How To Use
Copy the URL of the video you wish to download and enter it into the terminal after running the local version with local_ytdownload.py and it will download an m4a file.

If you wish to convert the m4a file, run local_converter.py and change the path accordingly.

For hosting or running with Docker, after you run the container, go to localhost:8000/download?url=<video_url> which will start the download that will go in your default downloads location. Please note some videos may not be available and this commonly gets outdated. So when a new pytubefix version releases, use that version instead.
